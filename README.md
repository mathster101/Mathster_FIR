# Mathster_FIR
*Basic implementation of an FIR filter

*Array of coefficients can be calculated here -> [https://www.arc.id.au/FilterDesign.html]
* Or use my tool -> [https://github.com/mathster101/FIR_Filter_Designer] 
*pass the generated coefficients array to the object constructor

*Uses circular buffers for enhanced speed
